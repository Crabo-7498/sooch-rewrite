Rewrite Project for Sooch

--------------------------

## Info
- **Language:** Python - Discord.py
- **Dependencies:** TBD

## Installation
- Install your favorite IDE (preferably PyCharm) and clone this project with Git. Open this project with your IDE and navigate to the root folder
  (in this case, sooch-rewrite). Type `pip install .` into the terminal. After installation, use `python3 setup.py`. Finally, `cd` to the sooch folder 
  and run sooch_bot (You will need your own bot to run this on, see the next bullet point for detail). The bot should now come online.
  
- To create a discord bot, go to the [Developer Dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select `New Application` (give it a name, 
  icon and whatever you want. Once created, navigate to the `BOT` tab and add a new bot. Copy the token and paste it into the `config.json` file (
  **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SHOW ANYONE YOUR TOKEN**!). Navigate back to the dashboard and go to the `OAuth2` tab. Select `BOT` in the checklist and give it 
  permissions. Copy the invite link and invite it to a server (we recommend you use a test server without any other purpose).
  
- If you need further help, consult the discord (located in [Resources](#resources))
